I've discovered that avoiding overeating helps me maintain a sharp and focused mind. I really like the idea of eating less and feeling more energetic, even though I feel very hungry sometimes. I've been trying to eat less for a while now, and I think it's working. I think I'll keep doing this for a while and see how it goes.
