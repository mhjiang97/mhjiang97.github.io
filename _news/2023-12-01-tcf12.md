I am delighted to share that the manuscript titled [*Transcription factor 12 mediated self-feedback regulatory mechanism is required in DUX4 fusion leukemia*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1514) has been accepted by the esteemed journal, [Clinical and Translational Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/20011326/homepage/productinformation.html), following an extensive review and revision process spanning nearly two years. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Dr Zhihui Li**, one of the co-authors, for her invaluable assistance. Without her contributions, I believe it would not have been possible for us to have this entire story accepted by CTM.
