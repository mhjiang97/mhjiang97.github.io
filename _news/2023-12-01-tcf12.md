I am delighted to share that the manuscript titled *Transcription factor 12 mediated self-feedback regulatory mechanism is required in DUX4 fusion leukemia* has been accepted by the esteemed journal, [Clinical and Translational Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/20011326/homepage/productinformation.html), following an extensive review and revision process spanning nearly two years. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Dr. Zhihui Li**, one of the co-authors, for her invaluable assistance. Without her contributions, I believe it would not have been possible for us to have this entire story accepted by CTM.

Once the final version of the publication is ready, I will share the comprehensive details of the study in the Blog section.
