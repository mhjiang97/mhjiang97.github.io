I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [School of Biomedical Sciences](https://www.sbms.hku.hk), [Li Ka Shing Faculty of medicine](https://www.med.hku.hk), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk) majoring in Bioinformatics. My research currently centers on two main topics: first, identifying novel structural variants to classify patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) using long-read sequencing; second, exploiting the mechanisms of APOBEC mutational signatures in ETV6::RUNX1/-like B-ALL. My work is supervised by [Professor Jason Wong](https://www.sbms.hku.hk/staff/jason-wing-hon-wong).

Prior to joining HKU, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Bioinformatics from [Harbin Medical University](https://www.hrbmu.edu.cn/english/) in 2019. Subsequently, I pursued my Master of Science degree in Biology at [Shanghai Institute of Hematology](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/institution-outputs/china/shanghai-institute-of-hematology-at-ruijin-hospital-sjtu/513906bb34d6b65e6a000158), [Ruijin Hospital](https://www.rjh.com.cn/2018RJPortal/main/rjsy/index.shtml), [School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) in 2022, doing research about deciphering the mechanism of leukemogenesis across various subtypes (*e.g.*, *IGH::DUX4* and *MEF2D* fusions). Following that, I worked as a technician for 10 months at [Shanghai Institute of Immunology](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sii/English.htm), where my responsibilities included sequencing platform construction.
