I am a first-year PhD student at [SBMS, HKU](https://www.sbms.hku.hk) majoring in Bioinformatics. My current research focuses on the identification of novel structural variants to subtype patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on long-read sequencing, advised by [Dr Jason Wong](https://www.sbms.hku.hk/staff/jason-wing-hon-wong).

Prior to joining HKU, I obtained my Master of Science degree in Biology from [Shanghai Institute of Hematology](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/institution-outputs/china/shanghai-institute-of-hematology-at-ruijin-hospital-sjtu/513906bb34d6b65e6a000158), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english/) in 2022. Following that, I spent 10 months as a technician at [Shanghai Institute of Immunology](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sii/English.htm).
