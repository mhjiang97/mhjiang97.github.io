I am a first-year Ph.D. student at HKU majoring in Bioinformatics. My current research focuses on the identification of novel structural variants to subtype patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on long-read sequencing. I am advised by [Dr Jason Wong](https://www.sbms.hku.hk/staff/jason-wing-hon-wong).

Prior to joining HKU, I obtained my Master of Science degree in Biology from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english/) in 2022. Following that, I spent 10 months as a technician at [Shanghai Institute of Immunology](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sii/English.htm).
